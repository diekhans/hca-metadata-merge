Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the interface between the plasma and the Ficoll\u2013 Paque gradient were collected and washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by centrifugation at 2000r.p.m. for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 5ml of red blood cell lysis buffer (Invitrogen, 00-4300) for 10min.",
