* big issue:
constructing versioned metadata graph is very tied to bundle, it is not construcable
only using de-duplicated metadata entities.
* bundle file is not downloads as part of metadata.
* links.json doesn;t contains it's uuid an version
* can't easily build graph.
- graph is not contained in 
* can't easly trace versions:
- links.json doesn't have versions
-
* terminology is inconsistent:
- md has document_id
- bundle has uuid
- links.json doesn't have province

* metadata files are not clearly identifiable.
